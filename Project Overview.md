# EHR Blockchain Project: Goals and Progress Report

## Original Project Goals

The project aims to create a private permissionless blockchain-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) system using Hyperledger Besu. The system was designed with the following core objectives:

1. **Hospital Network Structure**:
   - Create a network of 3 hospital nodes
   - Designate 1 node as a validator
   - Implement Proof of Authority consensus (QBFT or IBFT 2)

2. **User Interfaces**:
   - Patient Portal (React/Angular)
   - Doctor Dashboard (React/Angular)

3. **System Architecture**:
   - API Gateway (Node.js/Express) as middleware
   - Blockchain for storing EHR metadata and access control
   - IPFS for storing encrypted larger medical files
   - OAuth/IAM for scalable access control

4. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Access control mechanisms for patient data
   - EHR registry to track patient records
   - Patient record management

## What Has Been Achieved

### 1. Blockchain Setup and Configuration ✅

- **Hyperledger Besu Development Node**: Successfully deployed and running
  - Currently mining blocks (confirmed via logs)
  - RPC endpoint active on port 8545
  - Operating with chainID 2018 (default for Besu dev mode)

- **Smart Contracts Development and Deployment** ✅
  - **EHRRegistry Contract**: Deployed to `0x42699A7612A82f1d9C36148af9C77354759b210b`
    - Functions implemented: `doctors`, `patients`, `registerPatient`, `registerDoctor`, `isPatient`, `isDoctor`
  
  - **AccessControl Contract**: Deployed to `0xa50a51c09a5c451C52BB714527E1974b686D8e77`
    - Functions implemented: `accessPermissions`, `ehrRegistry`, `grantAccess`, `revokeAccess`, `hasAccess`
  
  - **PatientRecords Contract**: Deployed to `0x9a3DBCa554e9f6b9257aAa24010DA8377C57c17e`
    - Functions implemented: `accessControl`, `records`, `addMedicalRecord`, `getPatientRecords`

### 2. Frontend Development ✅

- **Patient Portal**:
  - Basic React application structure created
  - Running on localhost:3000
  - UI components for patient registration and record management

- **Doctor Dashboard**:
  - Basic React application structure created
  - Running on localhost:3001
  - UI components for doctor registration and patient record access

### 3. Backend Services Setup ✅

- **API Gateway**:
  - Basic Node.js/Express structure established
  - Ready for integration with blockchain and IPFS
  - IPFS software (Kubo) downloaded for future integration

- **Authentication Service**:
  - Structure created for handling user authentication
  - Ready for implementation of OAuth/IAM solutions

### 4. Network Configuration ✅

- **Development Environment**:
  - Single-node Besu development environment functioning
  - Contract migration and verification scripts working
  
- **Multi-Node Setup**:
  - Configuration files for 3 hospital nodes prepared
  - Scripts for QBFT/IBFT2 network deployment ready for testing

## How It Was Achieved

### Blockchain Implementation

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Hyperledger Besu was installed and configured in development mode
   - Genesis block configured with appropriate parameters
   - Node started with RPC endpoints enabled for contract deployment

2. **Smart Contract Development**:
   - Solidity contracts created for core functionality
   - Contracts compiled using Truffle framework
   - Deployed to the local Besu network using migration scripts
   - Contract verification performed to ensure correct deployment

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Created React applications using Create React App
   - Set up application routing and state management
   - Created UI components for different user roles and actions

4. **API and Authentication**:
   - Set up Express applications for API gateway and authentication
   - Created service structure for blockchain and IPFS integration
   - Prepared OAuth/IAM integration points

## Next Steps

Based on the current progress, these are the recommended next steps:

1. **Connect Frontends to Smart Contracts**:
   - Implement Web3.js integration
   - Add contract interaction functionality to UI components
   - Test full workflow from UI to blockchain

2. **IPFS Integration**:
   - Set up Kubo IPFS node
   - Implement file encryption and storage
   - Connect IPFS functionality to the API gateway

3. **Enhance Security**:
   - Implement OAuth/IAM solution
   - Add encryption for sensitive data
   - Audit smart contract security

4. **Multi-Node Deployment**:
   - Deploy the full 3-node network with QBFT/IBFT2 consensus
   - Test cross-hospital record sharing
   - Verify validator node functionality

5. **Usability Improvements**:
   - Add data visualization components
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Implement responsive design for mobile access

## Conclusion

The project has successfully established the foundation for a blockchain-based EHR system. The core components (blockchain, smart contracts, frontend applications, and backend services) are in place and functional. The next phase will focus on integrating these components, enhancing security, and improving the user experience to create a complete, production-ready system.
